Run exactly one image edit.

Follow the preloaded `composer-image-edit` skill. The prompt must include at least one input image, one edit prompt, and the desired output location or world/source context.

If the prompt is missing the image, edit prompt, or output target, stop and report the blocker.

Run generation to completion. Report input images, output image, request metadata, role, and prompt used.
